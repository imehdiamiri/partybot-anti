# Release log

## 2026-09-05 — Codex takeover / 1.0.1

### Recovery checkpoint

- Before changes: `f636fafc33d9920b24666688a7edcaa2a188d84c`.
- Tag: `checkpoint/2026-09-05-before-codex`.
- Full Git bundle (verified):
  `C:/Users/Mehdi/Documents/Codex/2026-08-14/playbot-antigravity-ios-android-audit/playbot-checkpoint-2026-09-05.bundle`.
- Existing origin: `https://github.com/imehdiamiri/partybot-anti`; push was blocked by
  auto-review pending explicit destination confirmation. Local checkpoint is complete.
- This checkpoint preserves the accumulated previous work; it is not a claim that
  every historical change was tested. Ignored credentials are not in the Git bundle.

### Changes

- Archived the Antigravity dispatch workflow; Codex now implements and releases.
- Removed unused AI toolkit and notifications dependencies. Retained the previously
  transitive `lucide-react-native@1.14.0` as a direct dependency used by Eye Sight.
- Declared Puppeteer as a dev dependency so existing browser checks survive npm install.
- Blocked Android external storage permissions; kept audio/network/haptics.
- Removed the unused iOS push entitlement through notifications package removal.
- Updated centralized privacy/terms links to clean URLs; removed duplicate cleanUrls config.
- Registered Firebase iOS app `1:1003126250476:ios:f23fe8802be78409fa7ec9`
  for `com.partybot`. Downloaded the official service file to the ignored local path
  and referenced it in app.json. Introspection now includes the real Google URL scheme.
- Set app/package/runtime version to 1.0.1 and preview builds to the preview channel.
- Created Expo preview channel pointing to its existing preview branch. Uploaded only
  the ten EXPO_PUBLIC client settings from local .env to the preview EAS environment.
- Added EAS upload ignore files: exclude .env and signing/server secrets, include only
  the required Firebase client service files for native prebuild.

### Verification

- Typecheck PASS; environment guard PASS; 45 game/auth tests PASS.
- Expo doctor PASS (18/18 after cleanup and again after the final dependency changes).
- Native introspection PASS: Google iOS scheme present, no aps-environment entitlement,
  both external-storage permissions marked tools:node=remove for manifest merging.
- Initial removal changed no retained package versions; one necessary direct dependency
  and one browser dev dependency were then explicitly added.
- Web export PASS: 91 routes, bundle `entry-a77aa41a7ccbf5b7750ac3c8706bb6f3.js`.
- Live `test-task50-release-integrity.js --base-url https://partybot.games` PASS:
  mobile 390x844 and desktop 1440x900, offline Memory Grid interaction, tool headers,
  Bottle image transparency/session, Sound Match/cards/profile primary paths,
  eight direct-entry/hard-refresh routes and browser back/forward. No recorded
  first-party errors, HTTP errors or forbidden dynamic requests. This is targeted
  release verification, not proof that every game and every device is bug-free.

### Published releases

- Prepared source commit: `9cf33e3a420c0c8ab261cc35852780e2af188ed4`.
- Tag: `release/1.0.1-prepublish`.
- Firebase Hosting deployment completed successfully (316 files) using
  `firebase deploy --only hosting --project partyplay-8 --non-interactive`.
- Live URLs: https://partybot.games and https://partyplay-8.web.app.
  Browser verification confirmed the exact exported bundle above. No database rules
  or Cloud Functions were deployed.
- EAS Update published successfully to preview (Android and iOS), runtime `1.0.1`:
  group `0b373b79-4c59-4a35-ad34-f7d4ddc8bcbe`.
  https://expo.dev/accounts/imehdiamiri/projects/expo-app/updates/0b373b79-4c59-4a35-ad34-f7d4ddc8bcbe
- Android preview build submitted: `248b4e41-f2a2-4301-a368-7e6bee8203d9`,
  version 1.0.1 / versionCode 1. EAS generated a new cloud-managed Android keystore.
  Build status at this entry: IN_PROGRESS; not yet certified as installable.
- iOS preview build did not start: EAS has no suitable physical-device internal
  distribution credentials. Needs owner-assisted Apple Developer authentication,
  signing/provisioning and device registration before retrying. No App Store or
  Play Store submission was performed.

### Final legal-link correction

- Live HTTPS checks exposed a certificate-name mismatch on www.partybot.games.
  Centralized legal/marketing URLs now use the working apex domain. DNS and
  certificates were not modified; www TLS needs separate investigation.
- Source commit: `69f4878ac648edf8e9eb4dd5bcf0ca4e6cdafed6`.
- Re-exported 91 web routes and successfully redeployed Firebase Hosting.
  Final live bundle: `entry-7a2512ae5fe9987e07daebb79b9e2103.js`.
- Verified live /profile references that exact bundle; both corrected legal URLs
  appear in it and return HTTPS 200 with the actual Privacy Policy / Terms titles.
  The earlier full browser smoke preceded this URL-only change.
- Superseding EAS preview update (Android/iOS, same compatible runtime 1.0.1):
  `4304af4d-5702-49f6-a23e-4c432325f40e`, published successfully.
  https://expo.dev/accounts/imehdiamiri/projects/expo-app/updates/4304af4d-5702-49f6-a23e-4c432325f40e
- The Android binary was submitted from 9cf33e3; the URL correction is delivered
  through this same-runtime OTA. Real-device installation/OTA receipt is not yet
  verified. Publishing an update does not prove a device has downloaded it.

### Mobile compatibility

The existing EAS build history uses old bundle/package identifiers; iOS builds are
simulator builds. No existing build proves physical-device compatibility with 1.0.1.
The new preview update requires a matching new native build. Do not present an update
URL as proof of Expo Go compatibility or successful installation on a real phone.

### Remaining configuration

- iOS physical-device signing/provisioning for com.partybot is blocked as described
  above. Android credentials were generated by EAS; retain them for future updates.
- Apple Team ID and Play signing SHA-256 fingerprints are still needed before publishing
  correct Universal Links/App Links association files. No placeholders were generated.
- RevenueCat product/entitlement dashboard setup and real-device auth/audio/purchase
  checks are not certified by typecheck, export or native introspection.

### Account hygiene

The Firebase CLI login-list JSON unexpectedly included authentication fields in tool
output. They were not added to project files, commits or releases. Future identity
checks must select only non-sensitive fields before emitting output. The owner should
revoke/re-authenticate that CLI session after this release; this is separate from
application Firebase client API keys, which are public configuration.
