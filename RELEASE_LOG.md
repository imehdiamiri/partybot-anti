# Release log

## 2026-09-05 — Codex takeover / 1.0.1 (publishing in progress)

### Recovery checkpoint

- Before changes: `f636fafc33d9920b24666688a7edcaa2a188d84c`.
- Tag: `checkpoint/2026-09-05-before-codex`.
- Full Git bundle (verified):
  `C:/Users/Mehdi/Documents/Codex/2026-08-14/playbot-antigravity-ios-android-audit/playbot-checkpoint-2026-09-05.bundle`.
- Existing origin: `https://github.com/imehdiamiri/partybot-anti`; push was blocked by
  auto-review pending explicit destination confirmation. Local checkpoint is complete.
- This checkpoint preserves the accumulated previous work; it is not a claim that
  every historical change was tested. Ignored credentials are not in the Git bundle.

### Changes

- Archived the Antigravity dispatch workflow; Codex now implements and releases.
- Removed unused AI toolkit and notifications dependencies. Retained the previously
  transitive `lucide-react-native@1.14.0` as a direct dependency used by Eye Sight.
- Declared Puppeteer as a dev dependency so existing browser checks survive npm install.
- Blocked Android external storage permissions; kept audio/network/haptics.
- Removed the unused iOS push entitlement through notifications package removal.
- Updated centralized privacy/terms links to clean URLs; removed duplicate cleanUrls config.
- Registered Firebase iOS app `1:1003126250476:ios:f23fe8802be78409fa7ec9`
  for `com.partybot`. Downloaded the official service file to the ignored local path
  and referenced it in app.json. Introspection now includes the real Google URL scheme.
- Set app/package/runtime version to 1.0.1 and preview builds to the preview channel.
- Created Expo preview channel pointing to its existing preview branch. Uploaded only
  the ten EXPO_PUBLIC client settings from local .env to the preview EAS environment.
- Added EAS upload ignore files: exclude .env and signing/server secrets, include only
  the required Firebase client service files for native prebuild.

### Verification so far

- Typecheck PASS; environment guard PASS; 45 game/auth tests PASS.
- Expo doctor PASS (18/18 after dependency cleanup).
- Native introspection PASS: Google iOS scheme present, no aps-environment entitlement,
  both external-storage permissions marked tools:node=remove for manifest merging.
- Initial removal changed no retained package versions; one necessary direct dependency
  and one browser dev dependency were then explicitly added.
- Web export PASS: 91 routes, bundle `entry-a77aa41a7ccbf5b7750ac3c8706bb6f3.js`.

### Mobile compatibility

The existing EAS build history uses old bundle/package identifiers; iOS builds are
simulator builds. No existing build proves physical-device compatibility with 1.0.1.
The new preview update requires a matching new native build. Do not present an update
URL as proof of Expo Go compatibility or successful installation on a real phone.

### Remaining configuration

- iOS physical-device signing/provisioning and Android signing for com.partybot must
  be confirmed by the native build attempt.
- Apple Team ID and Play signing SHA-256 fingerprints are still needed before publishing
  correct Universal Links/App Links association files. No placeholders were generated.
- RevenueCat product/entitlement dashboard setup and real-device auth/audio/purchase
  checks are not certified by typecheck, export or native introspection.

### Account hygiene

The Firebase CLI login-list JSON unexpectedly included authentication fields in tool
output. They were not added to project files, commits or releases. Future identity
checks must select only non-sensitive fields before emitting output. The owner should
revoke/re-authenticate that CLI session after this release; this is separate from
application Firebase client API keys, which are public configuration.
